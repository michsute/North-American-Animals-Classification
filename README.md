# North-American-Animals-Classification

Authors: Nadine Fl√ºck, Michelle Suter, Sevan Sherbetjian 
###  Project description
This project classifies 11 North American animal species and an empty class from camera trap images. It uses machine learning techniques to achieve it. The goal is to enhance wildlife conservation efforts by automating the identification process.

Here is an explanation of the notebooks:
+ python_data_split.ipynb was used to split the data on GpuHub.
+ data-visualisation.ipynb was used to analyse (Q&A)
+ evaluate_efficientnet_model.ipynb is a first test with EfficientNet
+ vision_train_evaluated.ipynb is a first test with ViT
+ resnet_no_training.ipynb classifies a samples of images on the original ResNet model without any training
+ resnet_final.ipynb is the trained model with best results
+ 

+ resnet_add_layers.ipynb and resnet_data_augmentation.ipynb are explorations mentioned in the report regarding data augmentation and additional layers, respectively.
